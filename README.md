- 👋 Hi, I’m @PaulAsselbergs Senior macos programmer
- 👀 I’m interested in c++ 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and  exploring github
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .
..I have worked 35 years with Mac's and before Apple"TOO"
Created MacTimetable, a school timetable program
from analysis to a commercial package.
MacTimetable v2.0 is a MacOS Carbon application which is now outdated.
V3.0 has been aborted and is say a delta (not epsylon for sure)
The Application (for MacOS intel) probably does not work anymore
It took me more than 25 years to make this little toy.
However.. The main organization, concept if you like, (File based) is stil valid.
I am 66 years old now, and making it up to date will take me another, say 8 years.
Then I will be a goathead (not an option).

So, what shall i do ?
Option 0: do nothing, ehhh... not my style.
Option 1: Trying to sell the thing
Option 2: Putting the code (c++) on GitHub for archeology.
Option 3: Any Ideas from you?
